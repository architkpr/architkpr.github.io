            <p><p>I am a graduate student at Columbia University in the City of New York, pursuing an MS in Computer Engineering.
         My interests are in cybersecurity, computer networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) and I aim to specialise my curriculum in these fields.
         I completed my undergraduate studies from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani in the beautiful state of Goa, India.
         I received a B.E. (Hons.) in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering and soon joined Columbia to pursue my master's.
         I am actively looking for internships in my areas of interest for summer 2020."""
         </p><br>
 <p>I pursued my undergraduate thesis at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia under the co-supervision of Prof. Salil Kanhere (UNSW) and Prof.   Sarang Dhongdi (BITS Pilani).
     I primarily worked on building the network to support an optimised blockchain for IoT security and privacy.
     I am extremely thankful to my co-supervisors for giving me this opportunity.
     My thesis played a major role in developing my interest in network security.
     As I learn more about cybersecurity, I am intrigued by its interaction with end users and their impact on this field.
     I hope to gain a deeper understanding of usable security principles and look forward to working under the guidance of Prof. Steven Bellovin in Spring 2020.</p>
