My name is Archit Kapoor. I am a graduate student at [Columbia University in the City of New York](https://engineering.columbia.edu/), with a major in Computer Engineering. My interests are in cybersecurity, computer networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) and I have specialised my curriculum in these fields. I completed my undergraduate studies at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) in Goa, India, where I received a B.E. (Hons.) in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering.

I pursued my undergraduate thesis at the [University of New South Wales (UNSW)](https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/) in Sydney, Australia under the co-supervision of Prof. Salil Kanhere (UNSW) and Prof. Sarang Dhongdi (BITS Pilani). <!-- I primarily worked on building the network to support an optimised blockchain for IoT security and privacy. I am extremely thankful to my co-supervisors for giving me this opportunity. My thesis played a major role in developing my interest in network security. As I learn more about cybersecurity, I am intrigued by its interaction with end users and their impact on this field. I hope to gain a deeper understanding of usable security principles and look forward to working under the guidance of Prof. Steven Bellovin in Spring 2020. -->
