              <p>I am a final year engineering student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani
<a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">(BITS-Pilani)</a> located in the beautiful state of Goa in India. I will graduate in May 2019 with a B.E. (Hons.) in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. I am currently in my final semester and after graduating I hope to pursue a M.S. in Computer Engineering.</p>

<p>In my penultimate semester, I completed my undergraduate thesis at the <a href="https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/computer-science-engineering/">University of New South Wales, Sydney</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://salilkanhere.net/">Prof. Salil Kanhere</a> and <a href="http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/sarang/profile">Dr. Sarang C. Dhongdi</a>. Together with <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~alidorri/">Ali Dorri</a> and team, I worked on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7917634">securing the Internet of Things using an optimized blockchain</a>. I was also a member of the <a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~srg/?#!index.md">Security Reading Group</a> there. This was a great learning experience for me, which intensified my interest in network security and privacy.</p>

<p>My research interests are in Computer Networking and the Internet of Things (IoT). I am particularly interested in improving the security and privacy of these networks. I like to keep myself updated on the latest activities in these fields. During my thesis I also developed an interest in Blockchain and Cryptography applications. I enjoy working with both hardware as well as software systems and try to take up projects at their intersection. You can check out my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jLCSFxLPcsrq06XPkkvJVgzjN9rOTYBK/view?usp=sharing">academic CV</a> for more information.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate studies, I was the President of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EIEBITSGoa/">Electronics and Instrumentation Association</a> of my campus. Along with my team, I started a series of short, interactive tech-sessions, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thestudentforumbpgc">The Student Forum BPGC</a>, where students and professionals, with a background in research, shared their experience with interested students. These sessions are active presently as well. I also help maintain the <a href="https://bitsrnd.wordpress.com/">BITS R&amp;D blog</a> which is updated regularly with articles about BITSians&rsquo; contributions in research and development activities.</p>

<p>I was an integral member of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DoPy.BITSGoa/">Department of Photography, BITS Goa</a> where I was involved in event photography, but soon shifted my focus to videography and video editing. I also worked with <a href="http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/raysonalex/profile">Dr. Rayson K. Alex</a> on various <a href="https://youtu.be/660e7uIbg3E">videos</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/bitsgoaofficial/videos/?ref=page_internal">faculty interviews</a>. I enjoy video and film editing projects. Contact me by <a href="mailto:kprarchit@gmail.com">email</a> if you have a freelance project for me in this domain.</p>
